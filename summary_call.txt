Summary of the conversation with Krzysztof:
it is possible to download this data in 3 ways:
upload assembly_summary_refseq.txt file to pandas and then search individual columns - i've got problems with charmap... can't get a specific column 
I can also work with entrez
or with bash - here's I've got problems with utf-8 encoding.
